# Setting up Environment and Running Flask Framework

This guide will walk you through setting up a virtual environment (`myenv`) and running a Flask application on macOS.

## Prerequisites

- macOS installed on your machine
- Python installed (preferably Python 3.x)
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone your Flask project repository from Git if you haven't already:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/advent0shafi/Simple-ATC-Checker-Flask.git
cd Simple-ATC-Checker-Flask
```

### 2. Set up Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. We'll use `venv` which comes built-in with Python.

#### Create Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment named `myenv`:

```bash
cd Simple-ATC-Checker-Flask
python3 -m venv myenv
```

#### Activate Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment `myenv`:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Flask and Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install Flask and any other dependencies required for your project:

```bash
pip install Flask
# Add other dependencies if needed
```

### 4. Run Flask Application

#### Set Flask App Environment Variable

Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to your Flask application's main file:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
# Replace app.py with your main Flask application file
```

#### Run Flask Application

Start the Flask development server:

```bash
flask run
```

The Flask server should now be running locally. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to see your Flask application in action.

### 5. Deactivate Virtual Environment

When you're done working on your project, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Additional Notes

- Remember to update `requirements.txt` if you add new dependencies to your project:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

- Customize the README according to your specific project requirements and structure.

Replace `https://github.com/advent0shafi/Simple-ATC-Checker-Flask.git` and `Simple-ATC-Checker-Flask` with the actual URL and name of your repository. Also, ensure to specify the exact licensing terms or URL provided by "Advent0Shafi" in the "Licensing" section. This ensures clarity on how your project can be used by others.
